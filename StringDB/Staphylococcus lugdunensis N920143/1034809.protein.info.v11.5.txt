1034809.SLUG_00010	dnaA	455	Plays an important role in the initiation and regulation of chromosomal replication. Binds to the origin of replication; it binds specifically double-stranded DNA at a 9 bp consensus (dnaA box): 5'- TTATC[CA]A[CA]A-3'. DnaA binds to ATP and to acidic phospholipids. 
1034809.SLUG_00020	dnaN	377	Confers DNA tethering and processivity to DNA polymerases and other proteins. Acts as a clamp, forming a ring around DNA (a reaction catalyzed by the clamp-loading complex) which diffuses in an ATP- independent manner freely and bidirectionally along dsDNA. Initially characterized for its ability to contact the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase III (Pol III), a complex, multichain enzyme responsible for most of the replicative synthesis in bacteria; Pol III exhibits 3'-5' exonuclease proofreading activity. The beta chain is required for initiation of replication as well as for proces [...]

1034809.SLUG_09990	ilvA	422	Catalyzes the anaerobic formation of alpha-ketobutyrate and ammonia from threonine in a two-step reaction. The first step involved a dehydration of threonine and a production of enamine intermediates (aminocrotonate), which tautomerizes to its imine form (iminobutyrate). Both intermediates are unstable and short-lived. The second step is the nonenzymatic hydrolysis of the enamine/imine intermediates to form 2- ketobutyrate and free ammonia. In the low water environment of the cell, the second step is accelerated by RidA.

Catalyzes an alkyl-migration followed by a ketol-acid reduction of (S)-2-acetolactate (S2AL) to yield (R)-2,3-dihydroxy-isovalerate. In the isomerase reaction, S2AL is rearranged via a Mg-dependent methyl migration to produce 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-ketobutyrate (HMKB). In the reductase reaction, this 2-ketoacid undergoes a metal-dependent reduction by NADPH to yield (R)-2,3-dihydroxy-isovalerate.

Binds to transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA), required for stable association of tmRNA with ribosomes. tmRNA and SmpB together mimic tRNA shape, replacing the anticodon stem-loop with SmpB. tmRNA is encoded by the ssrA gene; the 2 termini fold to resemble tRNA(Ala) and it encodes a 'tag peptide', a short internal open reading frame. During trans-translation Ala-aminoacylated tmRNA acts like a tRNA, entering the A-site of stalled ribosomes, displacing the stalled mRNA. The ribosome then switches to translate the ORF on  [...]

1034809.SLUG_20410	uvrB	661	The UvrABC repair system catalyzes the recognition and processing of DNA lesions. A damage recognition complex composed of 2 UvrA and 2 UvrB subunits scans DNA for abnormalities. Upon binding of the UvrA(2)B(2) complex to a putative damaged site, the DNA wraps around one UvrB monomer. DNA wrap is dependent on ATP binding by UvrB and probably causes local melting of the DNA helix, facilitating insertion of UvrB beta-hairpin between the DNA strands. Then UvrB probes one DNA strand for the presence of a lesion. If a lesion is found the UvrA subunits dissociate and the UvrB-DNA preincision [...]
